# cryptoclustering
Module 19 challenge

In the folder:
1. "Cyrpto_Clustering_hw.ipynb" is the completed homework file
2. "Cyrpto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb" original file that was provided and kept for reference
3. "cyrpto_market_data.csv" in the Resources folder is the file that was read into the homework file and original data that is being analyzed

Questions/Answers to questions within the homework:

1. Question: What is the best value for `k`?

Answer: Judging by the above elbow curve, I believe the best value for k is 3.

2. Question: What is the total explained variance of the three principal components?

Answer: The total explained variance is 89.4%. 

3. Question: What is the best value for `k` when using the PCA data?

  Answer: I believe the best value for k is either 3 or 4.


Question: Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?

  Answer: I don't believe that it differs much from the original data as the orignal graph looked like most of the currencies were clustered close together.

4.   Question: After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?

  Answer: I think using fewer features clustered the data closer together; it doesn't look like there is much impact. The above composites show that the predicted plots don't seem far from the original plots.
